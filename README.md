<h2 align="left">About me</h2>
Hi, I'm Le Hoang Minh (Don't know how to change the callsign, so just KOG2k2 for now), an embedded enthusiast from Vietnam. I like blinking LED 

Currently, I'm studying at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (HCMUT).

## My skills

Anything related to hardware or firmware developing. Currently learning Linux.

### C
For 1 year I developed firmware for IoT applications, familiar myself with serial communication protocols such as UART, SPI, I2C, CAN protocol, etc. I developed those mostly using STM32 with support from STM32CubeIDE. Did use a CMSIS library for DSP purposes.
